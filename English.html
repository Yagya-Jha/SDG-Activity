              Dear diary,<br>
              Today I am felling proud of me and my friends that this time we celebrated Holi and even not used things which can harm the environment !! I know you might be thinking that how we can celebrate Holi without harming our environment. Even I was surprised but we still did it.
              First we used Natural colours made out of flower petals instead of artificial ones. After we had played Holi, we went in parks and watered plants with left-over water. Then we collected all plastics which were scattered on the ground and stored them so we can give to anyone who deals with these kind of things. We also donated sweets among people to avoid wastage of food. Even one of my friend told us that we should donate our small clothes among children who were poor, and so we did. We also planted 5 trees, just imagine! And not only this we also took responsibility to water them. I know you will be proud of your bestie but still I was little worried that we followed such an amazing practice, but will other people follow this type of practice? And then, You will be glad to know! One of my friend told me that due to us practicing Eco-Friendly Practices while celebrating Holi, other people in our locality even practiced the same! And our photo is in todayâ€™s newspaper as well ! Yay!
              I am felling sleepy now,  And I think you too are, Good Night ! <br>
              <br>
